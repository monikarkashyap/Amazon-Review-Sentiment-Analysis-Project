There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.

What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",2012-01-04

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",2012-04-08

I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet.

They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.",2011-01-17

I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!",2012-01-21

They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta.

When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.

You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.

They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.

I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor.

It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",2009-09-27

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",2011-06-26

During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.

Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",2008-12-16

I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.",2012-10-05

The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.",2011-01-06

I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).",2009-11-26

However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee.

The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.",2011-06-23

I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).",2010-07-05

About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.",2010-10-29

You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don't particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.<br /><br />  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.<br /><br />  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty.

Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...

I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier.

Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.

Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day.

Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste.

I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!",2012-08-20

I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough?

I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have.

I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.

The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.",2012-07-10

I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",2011-12-14

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models.

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",2010-02-11

Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.",2012-08-20

With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]",2010-06-08

We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.

Glad I realized that.  So far so good !

(I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL!

My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.

The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up.

I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it.

They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in.

Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",2012-05-28

The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!",2010-03-03

Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )",2011-04-17

Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter.""",2011-11-12

I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the flavor of these candies.  I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werther's Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldn't stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.

I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the ""just add water"" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended...",2010-07-24
